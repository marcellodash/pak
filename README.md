# pak

Create, unpack, and print contents of Quake 1 and 2 PAK archives.

```
usage: pak [-hvlx] [PAK] [FILE...]
  -h        print this usage information
  -v        print version
  -l        lists files in PAK
  -x        extract files from PAK
  PAK       Quake PAK file
  FILE      arbitrary file
Without an option (hvlx) selected pak will pack the files into PAK
```

**Note:** this recently recovered program is one of the first I ever wrote. As
far as I remeber it is fully functional, no promises though! It should run on
GNU/Linux at least, and possibly other POSIX systems.
